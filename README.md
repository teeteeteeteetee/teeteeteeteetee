### Hey there, I'm Martin, but people refer me as "Tee" here :flushed::point_right::point_left:

I'm a (self taught) student/dev doing lots of "cool" stuff heh.. Knowing myself I shouldn't really go into details, but I'm trying my best to be really good at this thing if I'm being honest with myself, *but i suck lol*. I'm "really" great at Discord related stuff in Javascript and I also do back/front development for websites. Currently I'm still trying to learn C# from online resources that are publicly available on the internet, but since I'm a disgusting lazy subhuman being I literally can't get into it lol. // I would be glad if someone taught me C# into details...

I'm CURRENTLY using mainly Windows and Linux(Ubuntu) for managing servers. These are my current languages that I have taught myself: C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and little bit of Java... // if that's somewhat interesting

Anyways here are some of my website pages/profiles:
